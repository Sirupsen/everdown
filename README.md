# Everdown

You like editing your notes in good ol' Vim, but too you'd like to have them all indexed up by Evernote and available everywhere: on the mighty internet, you're fancy devices, and whatever.

Here's Everdown for you. It runs in the background and keeps a file tree up to date (buzz word: sync) with Evernote.

Oh and this *doesn't* work *yet*

## Installation

Sounds awesome, well how do I get this gem?

Good question, as with all good questions it can be answered with one line of bash:

    $ gem install everdown

## Usage

To deamonize Everdown for the grater awesome sync functionality, run it with:

    $ everdown -d

You might as well add this line to a file that get runs at every boot.

## CLI

For now, it's not present. Will it come? Well maybe, perhaps, not sure, it *might*. For now, use `ack` or whatever to search through the files.

"But what about my PDFs?", you might ask. To what I'd gently reply: "I don't know, yet". I'm sure some smart fella created a Vim plugin to read and edit them, when I find what I think is optimal, I'll add it here.
